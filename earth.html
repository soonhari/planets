    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. <br>
    While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. <br>
    About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. <br>
    The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. <br>
    Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. <br>
    Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.
