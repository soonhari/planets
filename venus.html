    Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. <br>
    As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.<br>
    Venus's orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, at latitudes with a day-night cycle, it is most readily visible for up to a few hours following the start of sunset or before sunrise. <br>
    At times, it has been seen in a completely dark sky. <br>
    Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[20] It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. <br>
    Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. <br>
    This means that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east.<br>
    Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.
